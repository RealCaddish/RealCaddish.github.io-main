  <h2 class="mb-2">Lexington Gig Map Updates</h2>
  <p class="text-muted">Published on November 21, 2025</p>

  <p>
    I just added a new batch of Lexington shows to the site—everything happening this weekend through January—and it felt like the right time to share a quick note. There's a lot coming up, from small-room sets to bigger touring acts, and I hope it helps you stumble into something new or finally catch a band you've been meaning to see.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also pushed a few small updates that make the page easier to use on your phone. If you're already out and want to see what's happening around town, it should load faster and feel a bit cleaner to scroll through. The goal is to make finding live music in the moment as easy as pulling your phone out of your pocket.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're organizing a show or know of something coming up, feel free to reach out. I update the listings once a month, and I'm always happy to add community events so more people hear about them. Just send the details and I'll make sure it gets folded into the next round.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks for reading, and I hope you find something on the list worth checking out.

  <h2 class="mb-2">Trailblogger: Mapping Hiking Trails and Outdoor Adventures</h2>
  <p class="text-muted">Published on November 7, 2025</p>

  <p>
    As someone who spends a lot of time thinking about space, place, and how we interact with our environment, 
    I've always been drawn to trails. There's something powerful about the way paths connect us to landscapes, 
    to history, and to each other. Whether it's a well-worn path through a local park or a remote backcountry 
    route, trails tell stories about how people move through and experience the natural world.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why I created <strong>Trailblogger</strong> — an interactive web mapping application that helps 
    hikers, backpackers, and outdoor enthusiasts discover, explore, and document trails. This project combines 
    my passion for GIS with my love for the outdoors, creating a tool that makes trail information more 
    accessible and visual.
  </p>

  <p>
    The application is built using <strong>Flask</strong> as the backend framework, which provides a clean and 
    flexible way to handle server-side logic, API endpoints, and data processing. On the frontend, the map uses 
    <strong>Leaflet.js</strong> to create an interactive experience where users can explore trail networks, 
    view elevation profiles, and understand the spatial relationships between different routes. The combination 
    of Flask's server capabilities with Leaflet's mapping functionality creates a seamless user experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    For data storage, I've implemented a strategy that balances performance with flexibility. The trail data is 
    stored in a structured format that allows for efficient querying and updates. This approach ensures that 
    the map can handle large datasets while maintaining fast load times and responsive interactions. The storage 
    strategy also supports future expansion, making it easy to add new trails, user contributions, or additional 
    data layers as the project grows.
  </p>

  <p>
    For me, this project represents the intersection of several interests: cartography, outdoor recreation, 
    web development, and making spatial data useful for everyday decision-making. Whether you're planning a 
    weekend hike or researching a longer backpacking trip, having access to well-designed trail maps can make 
    all the difference in your experience.

  <h2 class="mb-2">Mapping Scooter Injuries in Lexington</h2>
  <p class="text-muted">Published on July 14, 2025</p>

  <p>
    Hoping everyone is having a restful summer. I wanted to take a moment to share a
    recent project that feels especially personal to me. A close loved one of mine
    was involved in a motorized scooter accident here in Lexington — something that
    shook me and got me thinking more seriously about how these devices are affecting
    our community.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve always believed in the power of maps to tell stories and reveal patterns, and
    this one is no exception. Motorized scooters might seem like a fun, harmless
    mobility solution, but the data paints a different picture. I built this map
    to better understand — and help others visualize — the impact these accidents have
    had on our city between 2019 and 2022.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using <strong>Leaflet.js</strong> and cluster analysis, this map compiles publicly
    available data from the <strong>Lexington-Fayette County Police Department</strong>
    and highlights where incidents have occurred over time. It's a tool for awareness,
    transparency, and hopefully, action.
