              <p>Welcome!</p>
              <p>My name is Nathaniel, and welcome to my slice of portfolio pie.</p>
              <p>This digital space is my basecamp for everything professional, as well as a place where I’ll share with you my art, my thoughts, and whatever else is a boon unto the soul, or whatever.</p>
              <p>Let’s get down to why you’re here in the about me section:</p>
              <p>A few years ago, I developed a serious passion for learning the tools behind GIS and data visualization. My interest in GIS was born out of an extended field research stay in Varanasi, India during the summer months of 2012. Much of the project involved documenting locations of little Hindu temples or 'mandirs' that are dotted throughout the city. The project was my first exposure to GIS and included some of my most cherished experiences, such as meeting the local adherents and priests of a given mandir, documenting the myriad deities associated with each, as well as learning more intimately about the sacred space that each deity inhabits through the people, culture, history, and space.</p>
              <p>This research paved the way for my own curiosity in data and what Jack Dangermond refers to as "the science of where", or more generally referred to through the term 'GIScience'. I've had great fortune with the field because it has fostered a sense of passion, curiosity, a growth-mindset through exciting new tools, libraries, and maps that so many people in this community are contributing to the field.</p>
              <p>For those interested in knowing more, feel free to continue to read the extended version below.

              <p>After graduating from my alma mater at Centre College in 2015, my journey led to pursue an M.A. in Archaeology at Tel Aviv University where I gained further knowledge and expertise in anthropology and archaeological method from various field schools and academic research projects such as the copper mining sites and smelting sites in The Central Timna Valley, excavations at Kiriat-Jearim outside of Jerusalem, and the major pottery manufacturing town of Shikhin in the Beit Natofa Valley. </p>
              <p>In 2022, I graduated from the University of Kentucky with an M.S. in Digital Mapping. The program further expanded my knowledge with technical sklls and I learned version control using Git, GeoJSON standards, and building web maps with extensive focus on JavaScript and mapping libraries such as Leaflet, Mapbox GL, and D3.</p>
              <p>Between my degrees and professional work, I’ve developed a strong background in GIS project management through various industries in the private sector. I’ve worked with digitization tools, GIS modeling, database design with PostgreSQL, GIS data management with utility projects (TWE Transmission Line, DOT), making digital/static maps for environmental reports and surveys, QA/QC of USDA NAIP imagery, LiDAR point cloud analysis, and geoprocessing in open-source (QGIS) and ESRI (ArcGIS Pro) environments.</p>
              <p>These experiences led to much stronger skills with PostgreSQL, data wrangling with Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, BeautifulSoup), building front-end web maps and data visuals with JavaScript (D3, Leaflet, Mapbox GL JS), and finally, a framework of how these elements fuse together, sewing a meaningful tapestry of questions and answers that the data can't portray on face value.</p>
              <p>Ever since I embarked on this journey, my curiosity has only grown deeper. By exploring data through the lens of GIS, I strive to uncover truths that can guide better decision-making. If you're feeling a bit lost or have a project in mind that could use a solid map, don't hesitate to reach out.
